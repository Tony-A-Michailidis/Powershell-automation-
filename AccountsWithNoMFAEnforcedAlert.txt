    .DESCRIPTION
        Returns a list of users with no MFA enforced. The Connect-MsolService will require a login/password (can't do it with a service principle, unless you have figured it out!) so it will trigger 
        the MFA for the login admin user. So this is a script you copy and paste in your Powershell on your desktop to run and get results. 
    
    .PARAMETER none

Toronto azure data center IP addresses, just in case we can exclude them from the MFA, attempts to do so have failed and MFA still kicks in!
